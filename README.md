#Laravel Project Setup and Instructions
#Overview
This repository contains a Laravel project with Docker setup for local development. It includes RESTful API endpoints for users and blog posts, a queuing system for background jobs, and a caching mechanism to improve performance.

Prerequisites
Docker: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
PHP: PHP 8.0 or higher (required for local development without Docker).
Composer: PHP dependency manager (required for local development without Docker).
Setup

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-laravel-project.git
   cd your-laravel-project

2. Docker Setup
   a. Build Docker Containers
   docker-compose build

   docker-compose up -d

    This command will start the containers in detached mode. You can access the application at http://localhost.

3. Environment Configuration
   a. Copy Environment File
   Copy the .env.example to .env:

    b. Generate Application Key
    Generate a new application key:

docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
c. Database Migrations
Run database migrations to set up the schema:
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate

d. Seed the Database (Optional)
Seed the database with initial data:
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed

4. Access the Application
   Web Application: http://localhost

API Endpoints:
GET /api/users - List all users
GET /api/users/{id} - Get user by ID
POST /api/users - Create a new user

GET /api/blog-posts - List all blog posts
GET /api/blog-posts/{id} - Get blog post by ID
POST /api/blog-posts - Create a new blog post
PUT /api/blog-posts/{id} - Update blog post by ID
DELETE /api/blog-posts/{id} - Delete blog post by ID 5. Queue Workers

5. To handle background jobs, run the queue worker:
   docker-compose exec app php artisan queue:work

6. Cache Clearing and Configurations
   a. Clear Cache
   docker-compose exec app php artisan cache:clear
   docker-compose exec app php artisan config:cache
   b. Optimize Application
   docker-compose exec app php artisan optimize
   Development

7. Accessing the Application Container
   To run commands inside the application container:

docker-compose exec app bash 2. Running Tests
To run tests within the Docker container:

docker-compose exec app php artisan test

8. Updating Dependencies
   Update PHP dependencies with Composer:
   docker-compose exec app composer install

9. Frontend Development
   For frontend assets:
   docker-compose exec app npm install
   docker-compose exec app npm run dev

Troubleshooting
Database Connection Issues: Ensure Docker containers are running and check .env for correct database configuration.
Permission Issues: Adjust file permissions if you encounter permission errors.
Queue Issues: Ensure the queue worker is running and check the queue configuration in .env.
